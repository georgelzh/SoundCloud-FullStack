"""
In addition to putting a str as a GridFS file, we can also put any file-like object
(an object with a read() method). GridFS will handle reading the file in chunk-sized 
segments automatically. We can also add additional attributes to the file as keyword 
arguments:
"""

b = fs.put(fs.get(a), filename="foo", author = '5efab5f4eccfc803a60c82dc')
out = fs.get(b)
out.read()
# b'hello world'

# access to attributes
o.filename # 'foo'
o.author #'5efab5f4eccfc803a60c82dc'
o.upload_date
